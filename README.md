### Kobi Medrish
I am an embedded developer and a shell dweller. I work mostly with Linux and dabble in devops. My tools of the trade are tmux, neovim, emacs and nix. 
I am on the constant lookout to remove friction form my workflow, for new
things to learn to broaden my perspective and hone my craft. I share the journey on my [site](https://www.kobimedrish.com).
